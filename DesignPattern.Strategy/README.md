## Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

In the context of the provided code, different compression strategies (such as RAR and ZIP) are implemented as separate classes. The `CompressionContext` class receives a strategy object and delegates the compression operation to it. This makes it easy to switch between different compression algorithms without modifying the context or the client code.

**Benefits:**
- Promotes the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new strategies to be added without changing existing code.
- Reduces code duplication by encapsulating algorithms.
- Makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

**Example Usage:**
```csharp
ICompressionStrategy compressionStrategy = new RarCompressionStrategy();
CompressionContext compressionContext = new CompressionContext(compressionStrategy);
compressionContext.CompressFile("rarexample.txt");

ICompressionStrategy zipCompressionStrategy = new ZipCompressionStrategy();
CompressionContext zipCompressionContext = new CompressionContext(zipCompressionStrategy);
zipCompressionContext.CompressFile("zipexample.txt");
```
